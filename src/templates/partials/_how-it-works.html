							The neural network collects and analyses data 24/7 and provides forecasts for various cryptocurrencies’ exchange rates. There are three types of forecasts: for 24 hours, for 48 hours and for one week. Depending on the type of forecast and the chosen cryptocurrency, the accuracy of the forecast spans within the range of 70-90%.
